-> Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI),
   and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.

-> Data scientists use methodologies that include processes or activities to perform to obtain results. 
   The methodologies are scientific, so the key is that they are repeatable.

-> Three widely used data science methodologies are: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM),
   Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD), and Sample Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess (SEMMA)

-> 1. CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
  A six-phase iterative process focused on solving business problems through data mining:
  Phases: Business Understanding â†’ Data Understanding â†’ Data Preparation â†’ Modeling â†’ Evaluation â†’ Deployment
  Widely used, flexible, and tool-independent.

->  2. KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)
  A broad framework for extracting useful patterns from data.
  Steps: Selection â†’ Preprocessing â†’ Transformation â†’ Data Mining â†’ Interpretation/Evaluation
  Focuses on turning raw data into knowledge, often used in academic research.

-> 3. SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess)
  Developed by SAS, focused on technical tasks of data mining.
  Steps:

   Sample: Select a representative dataset

   Explore: Visualize and discover patterns

   Modify: Transform variables

   Model: Apply algorithms

   Assess: Evaluate model performance
  ðŸ”¬ More model-centric, used mostly with structured data.

-> Key activities that take place during a data science project are:

   Business understanding
   Data exploration and preparation
   Data representation and transformation
   Data visualization and presentation
   Train data models
   Deploy data models

-> Those who work in data science use technologies and tools to build models.
   The models are used to predict outcomes or discover underlying patterns. 
   The intent is to gain insights that lead to actions that improve future outcomes.

-> Data scientists use machine learning to train models. Machine learning is essentially teaching a computer to solve problems.
   It allows a machine to learn from data without programming it with rules. The machine can learn from the data itâ€™s given.

-> Data science is a team effort! Data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers collaborate to solve business problem
