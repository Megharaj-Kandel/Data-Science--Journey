-> It’s important for businesses across industries to find insights to potentially improve operations,
   get a better understanding of customers or end users, increase profits, and much more.
 
-> Data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, and transforming data to obtain insights to help make better and informed decisions.

-> Structured data can be organized in databases with many columns and rows. Unstructured data lacks organization
   and can be data such as tweets, customer comments, medical records, and so on.

-> Quantitative data means you can count it and it’s numerical. Qualitative data means you can't count it, and it’s not numerical. 
   When you think of qualitative data, think “quality”—something you can categorize about data instead.

-> Big data is characterized by the 5 V’s: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, and Value.
  
 - Volume – Huge amount of data generated (e.g., terabytes to petabytes).
 - Variety – Different types of data (text, images, videos, etc.).
 - Velocity – Speed at which data is created and processed.
 - Veracity – Accuracy and trustworthiness of data.
 - Value – Usefulness of the data in decision-making or insights. 

-> There are four types of data analytics that answer key questions, build on each other, and increase in complexity:

   - Descriptive
   - Diagnostic
   - Predictive
   - Prescriptive
  
-> While there is no single, defined data analysis process, these are the typical steps to follow:

   - Collect
   - Clean
   - Analyze
   - Visualize

-> A data visualization, such as a chart, graph, or map, 
   helps you explore and interpret data during analysis to identify patterns or trends, 
   communicate results, and help people understand the insights to make decisions.

-> One type of visualization can display data in a better way, compared to another type of visualization.
   The goal is to have a visualization that’s effective, attractive, and impactive.
